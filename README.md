### What I learned

In this project I've used `.nodeName`{:.js} the first time. It was a part of the event delegation logic. I found this event handling pattern very powerful and easy to code.


```js
 if(e.target.nodeName == "BUTTON") {
        ...
    }
 if(e.target.nodeName == "INPUT") {
    ...
    }
```
